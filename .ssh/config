    # «Sets the number of server alive messages (see below) 
    # which may be sent without ssh(1) receiving any messages back from the server. 
    # If this threshold is reached while server alive messages are being sent, 
    # ssh will disconnect from the server, terminating the session. 
    # It is important to note that the use of server alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive (below). 
    # The server alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable.
    # The TCP keepalive option enabled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. 
    # The server alive mechanism is valuable
    # when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become inactive.
    # The default value is 3. 
    # If, for example, ServerAliveInterval (see below) is set to 15 and ServerAliveCountMax is left at the default, 
    # if the server becomes unresponsive, ssh will disconnect after approximately 45 seconds. 
    # This option applies to protocol version 2 only.»
